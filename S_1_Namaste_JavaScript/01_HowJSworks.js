// Everything in JavaScript happens inside an execution context

// There are two components in Execution context 
// 1. Memory context (Variable environment)
// 2. Code component (Thread of Execution)

// Now becuase of Threaded Execution there is one more property of JavaScript which says ->
// JavaScript is a synchronous single threaded language.
// It means JS can execute 1 command at a time in a specific order.
