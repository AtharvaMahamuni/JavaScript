// What happens when you run the JS code?
// When we run the JS program the execution context gets created.

// In JS execution context there are 2 different components -
// Memory and code component.
// The execution context gets created in 2 phases -
// 1. In 1st phase the memory component gets created 
// 2. In 2nd phase the code component gets created.
